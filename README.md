Artificial Intelligence Trustworthy Course Projects

This repository contains the course projects for **Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence**, taught by Dr. Mostafa Tavassolipour at the University of Tehran in Spring 2024.

There are four projects in total. For each project, you will find:

* A detailed description
* Project report
* Source code
* Datasets
* All related materials

## CA1

This folder contains all files related to the first project.

In this section, we focus on the fundamental concepts of **generalization** and **robustness** in neural networks.
Our goal is to understand how to make our models more **generalizable** and **robust** through practical experiments and theoretical exploration.

Of course! Here is a professional and clear English version for your README:

## CA2

In this project, we explore the **interpretability of neural network models**.

* In the first question, we examine the interpretability of neural networks using tabular data and compare several different interpretability methods.
* In the second question, we focus on interpretability in the context of image data.
Certainly! Here is a professional and clear English version for your README:

## CA3

In this project, the main objective is to achieve a deeper understanding of **causal relationships** among variables and to interpret models through these causal links.
By incorporating causality into interpretability, we can gain more profound insights into complex phenomena and make better-informed decisions regarding potential interventions.

## CA4

The goal of this project is to investigate and implement key topics in **Security**, **Privacy**, and **Fairness** within machine learning models and neural networks.
