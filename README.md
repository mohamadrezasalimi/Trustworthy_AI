## CA1

This folder contains all files related to the first project.

In this section, we focus on the fundamental concepts of **generalization** and **robustness** in neural networks.
Our goal is to understand how to make our models more **generalizable** and **robust** through practical experiments and theoretical exploration.

Of course! Here is a professional and clear English version for your README:

## CA2

In this project, we explore the **interpretability of neural network models**.

* In the first question, we examine the interpretability of neural networks using tabular data and compare several different interpretability methods.
* In the second question, we focus on interpretability in the context of image data.
